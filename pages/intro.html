                      <h4>1. Introduction to Programs and Programming Languages</h4>
                      <p>• A program (or software) is a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do.</p>
                      <p>• Programs are used to interact and communicate with computers.</p>
                      <p>• To write programs, we use programming languages.</p>
                      <p>• Programming languages are languages that are used to write programs and are understood by computers.</p>

                      <h4>2. Machine Language</h4>
                      <p>• Machine language is the computer's native language, using only 0s and 1s (binary).</p>
                      <p>• It is the main language of the computer, and all instructions must eventually be translated into machine language before execution.</p>
                      <p>• Machine language is machine-dependent, meaning it differs among different types of machines.</p>
                      <p>• Example: This is how you add 2 and 3 (2+3) in machine language: <span>1010101010101010</span></p>

                      <h4>3. Assembly Language</h4>
                      <p>• Assembly language was developed to make programming easier compared to machine language.</p>
                      <p>• It is also machine-dependent, but it uses keywords (e.g., <span>add</span>, <span>sub</span>) instead of binary codes.</p>
                      <p>• Assembly code must be translated to machine code using a program called an assembler before execution.</p>
                      <p>• Example: This is how you add 2 and 3 in assembly language: <span>add 2, 3, result  </span></p>

                      <h4>4. High-Level Programming Languages</h4>
                      <p>• High-level programming languages use English words and are easier to learn and use.</p>
                      <p>• They are machine-independent, meaning programs can run on different machines.</p>
                      <p>• Each instruction in a high-level language is called a statement.</p>
                      <p>• A program written in a high-level language is called source code or a source program.</p>
                      <p>• Example: This is how you add 2 and 3 in Java (a high-level language): <span>result = 2 + 3;</span></p>
                      
                      <h4>5. Translating Source Code to Machine Code</h4>
                      <p>• Source code written in high-level languages cannot be directly executed by computers.</p>
                      <p>• It must be translated into machine code before execution.</p>
                      <p>• This translation can be done using a compiler or an interpreter.</p>
                      <p>• A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code at once, producing an executable file.</p>
                      <p>• An interpreter translates and executes each statement of the source code one by one.</p>

                      <h3>Lesson Content</h3>
                      <h4>1. General Information about Java</h4>
                      <p>• Java was developed at Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle in 2010).</p>
                      <p>• It is a general-purpose and powerful programming language.</p>
                      <p>• Java is used for developing software that runs on mobile, desktop, and server platforms.</p>
                      <p>• Java is machine-independent, meaning programs can run on different machines.</p>

                      <h4>2. Java Language Specification</h4>
                      <p>• The Java Language Specification defines the syntax and semantics of Java.</p>
                      <p>• Syntax refers to the grammar rules for writing valid Java code.</p>
                      <p>• Semantics refers to the meaning and behavior of Java code.</p>
                      <p>• Syntax errors occur when code violates the grammar rules.</p>
                      <p>• Semantic errors occur when code is grammatically correct but lacks meaning.</p>

                      <h4>3. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</h4>
                      <p>• An API, or library, contains predefined Java code that developers can use.</p>
                      <p>• APIs provide ready-to-use code, making development faster and easier.</p>
                      <p>• Developers don't have to write everything from scratch.</p>

                      <h4>4. High-Level Programming Languages</h4>
                      <p>• Java Standard Edition (Java SE): Used for developing desktop applications.</p>
                      <p>• Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE): Used for developing server-side applications.</p>
                      <p>• Java Micro Edition (Java ME): Used for developing mobile applications.</p>
                      <p>• Java SE is the foundation for all other editions.</p>
                      
                      <h4>5. Java Development Kit (JDK)</h4>
                      <p>• The JDK is a set of programs that enable Java development.</p>
                      <p>• It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for running Java programs.</p>
                      <p>• Both JDK and JRE contain the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
                      <p>• The JVM executes Java programs on different machines, making Java machine-independent.</p>

                      <h4>6. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h4>
                      <p>• An IDE is a program that provides an environment for writing, compiling, building, and running Java programs.</p>
                      <p>• IDEs typically include tools for debugging and finding errors.</p>
                      <p>• Popular Java IDEs include NetBeans, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA</p>

                      <p>• Assembly code must be translated to machine code using a program called an assembler before execution.</p>
                      <p>• Example: This is how you add 2 and 3 in assembly language: <span>add 2, 3, result  </span></p>

                      <h4>4. High-Level Programming Languages</h4>
                      <p>• High-level programming languages use English words and are easier to learn and use.</p>
                      <p>• They are machine-independent, meaning programs can run on different machines.</p>
                      <p>• Each instruction in a high-level language is called a statement.</p>
                      <p>• A program written in a high-level language is called source code or a source program.</p>
                      <p>• Example: This is how you add 2 and 3 in Java (a high-level language): <span>result = 2 + 3;</span></p>
                      
                      <h4>5. Translating Source Code to Machine Code</h4>
                      <p>• Source code written in high-level languages cannot be directly executed by computers.</p>
                      <p>• It must be translated into machine code before execution.</p>
                      <p>• This translation can be done using a compiler or an interpreter.</p>
                      <p>• A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code at once, producing an executable file.</p>
                      <p>• An interpreter translates and executes each statement of the source code one by one.</p>

                    <h3>Lesson Content</h3>

                    <h4>1. Introduction to Programs and Programming Languages</h4>
                    <p>• A program (or software) is a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do.</p>
                    <p>• Programs are used to interact and communicate with computers.</p>
                    <p>• To write programs, we use programming languages.</p>
                    <p>• Programming languages are languages that are used to write programs and are understood by computers.</p>

                    <h4>2. Machine Language</h4>
                    <p>• Machine language is the computer's native language, using only 0s and 1s (binary).</p>
                    <p>• It is the main language of the computer, and all instructions must eventually be translated into machine language before execution.</p>
                    <p>• Machine language is machine-dependent, meaning it differs among different types of machines.</p>
                    <p>• Example: This is how you add 2 and 3 (2+3) in machine language: <span>1010101010101010</span></p>

                    <h4>3. Assembly Language</h4>
                    <p>• Assembly language was developed to make programming easier compared to machine language.</p>
                    <p>• It is also machine-dependent, but it uses keywords (e.g., <span>add</span>, <span>sub</span>) instead of binary codes.</p>
                    <p>• Assembly code must be translated to machine code using a program called an assembler before execution.</p>
                    <p>• Example: This is how you add 2 and 3 in assembly language: <span>add 2, 3, result  </span></p>

                    <p>• High-level programming languages use English words and are easier to learn and use.</p>
                    <p>• They are machine-independent, meaning programs can run on different machines.</p>
                    <p>• Each instruction in a high-level language is called a statement.</p>
                    <p>• A program written in a high-level language is called source code or a source program.</p>
                    <p>• Example: This is how you add 2 and 3 in Java (a high-level language): <span>result = 2 + 3;</span></p>
                    
                    <h4>5. Translating Source Code to Machine Code</h4>
                    <p>• Source code written in high-level languages cannot be directly executed by computers.</p>
                    <p>• It must be translated into machine code before execution.</p>
                    <p>• This translation can be done using a compiler or an interpreter.</p>
                    <p>• A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code at once, producing an executable file.</p>
                    <p>• An interpreter translates and executes each statement of the source code one by one.</p>
